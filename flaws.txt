When extend, need to catch incorrect component names
<graph name="g1">
     <line through="(-5,9)" name="l" />
     <pointd extend="$l.point1" name="A" />
</graph>



How should ref's work. Still call it <ref>? Still combine with url?

<ref uri="http://umn.edu" >hello</ref>

<section name="sec">
  <title>hello</title>
</section>

<ref to="$sec">See section</ref>
<ref target="$sec">See section</ref>


Refs to other docs on doenet.org?

Use contentId?

<ref doc="afslakjsflasdf" to="$sec" />

where do we put deprecated properties, tags?





fix error message in function test: warnings on bad domain



For test "copy single propIndex of rows and columns, dot and array notation" in spreadsheet
It gives warnings about prop not existing, which it shouldn't.

And if change the references to extends of rows and columns, then the test reports errors, but still passes


specifySingleVariant.test.ts "nested selects"
If don't specify `uniqueVariants="false"` then mainly selects number as it is overweight from having lots of variants


test: submitted response menu

test: rounding of list components
