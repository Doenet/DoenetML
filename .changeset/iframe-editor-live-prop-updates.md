Fix iframe-wrapped `<DoenetEditor>` so prop changes no longer reload the iframe and reset editor state. Toggling `readOnly`, `showDiagnostics`, `showResponses`, `width`, and similar serializable props now propagates to the inner editor live via Comlink instead of being baked into a new `srcDoc`. `doenetML` is treated as initial-only after mount — changes are silently ignored so in-progress edits aren't overwritten; consumers wanting to seed a new document should remount via a parent `key=`. In `@doenet/standalone`, `renderDoenetViewerToContainer` and `renderDoenetEditorToContainer` now cache the React root per container so repeat calls re-render in place instead of mounting a competing root.
