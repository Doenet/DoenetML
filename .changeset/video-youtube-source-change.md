Fix `<video>` with a YouTube source so the player reloads correctly when the YouTube id changes (for example when `youtube` is bound to a `choiceInput` or any reactive value), and so the player initializes once the YouTube IFrame API finishes loading. Previously the new video silently failed to load and stale internal timers could throw against the destroyed player.
