Improve list-item first-child alignment for section/task/problem-style numbering when content starts with block renderers.

This update standardizes list-item alignment signals across block components, updates section and sideBySide rendering to top-align numbering with block-first content, and adds Cypress coverage for the new behavior (including answer and choiceInput cases).
