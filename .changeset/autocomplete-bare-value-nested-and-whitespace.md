Fix two autocomplete papercuts when typing an unquoted attribute value.

- The wrap-in-quotes / value-completion hint for a bare value past `=` (e.g. `<math name=hello`) now also fires inside a parent element. Previously the parser's error-recovery wrapped the bare run in an `AttributeValue` node when the partial element was followed by `</...>` or another `<`, which masked the bare-value branch. The cursor-position detector now distinguishes a real quoted value (starts with `"`/`'`) from this recovered form.
- The value popup no longer flickers closed when whitespace follows `=` (e.g. `<math simplify= full`). The CodeMirror gate that decides whether to ask the LSP for completions now treats whitespace immediately following `=` as "still in trigger reach," so typing a space after `=` doesn't close the popup that opened on `=`. Scoped to `=` only — other server triggers (`<`, `/`, `"`, `'`) don't reopen the popup across whitespace, so `<math name="hello" ` behaves like `<math ` and waits for a letter before suggesting attributes.
- Typing the *closing* quote of an attribute value (e.g. `<math name="hello"`) no longer pops a popup of attribute names. `"` and `'` are server trigger characters so the opening quote can pop value completions, but the gate now distinguishes openers from closers by counting prior occurrences of the typed quote between the last `<` and the cursor — an even count is an opener, odd is a closer. This correctly classifies `<math name="hello" simplify="` as an opener (two prior `"` chars from `name="hello"`) while still treating the closing `"` of `<math foo="x=y"` as a closer, so closers behave like `<math ` and wait for a letter before suggesting attributes.
