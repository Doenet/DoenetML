//! # Components
//!
//! A DoenetML _component_ controls what happens when an XML tag is written in DoenetML source code.
//! For example, the `P` component controls how a `<p>...</p>` tag is rendered, what its children are,
//! what its props are, etc..
//!
//! Authored components are defined in the in the [`doenet`] module.
//!
//! ## Features
//! - [`component`] contains the [`Component`] struct,
//! which abstracts over all DoenetML components. It is what is used by [`Core`](crate::core) and
//! should not be used directly by component authors.
//! - [`special`] contains implementations of the special [`_Error`] and
//! [`_External`] components. These are treated differently from other
//! _DoenetML_ components during the render process.
