//! # DoenetML Core
//!
//! The backbone of _DoenetML_. This crate is architecture-agnostic. It can be compiled to WebAssembly
//! or as a native binary.
//!
//! ## Features
//!  - [`Components`](components) are the building blocks of _DoenetML_. They are the smallest unit of a
//!  _DoenetML_ document, and (most of the time) correspond to XML tags that the user has typed
//!  in their _DoenetML_ source code. Examples include `<p />` and `<textInput />`
//!  - [`Core`](core) computes properties and relationships between DoenetML components. It enables
//!  interactivity via `Action`s, allowing components to respond and re-render based on user input.
//!  - [`Graph`](graph) provides an abstract implementation of a directed graph which is used
//!  to track dependencies among _DoenetML_ components and their properties.
