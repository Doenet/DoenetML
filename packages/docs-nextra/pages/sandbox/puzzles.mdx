### Puzzle 1: Line through a point
Edit the starter code below to create a graph that shows a [line](line.mdx) passing through a [point](point.mdx). 
When the point is dragged, the line moves with it, rotating around the point's original location.
When the line is clicked and dragged, the line translates with its original slope. 

```doenet-editor-horiz
<graph>
    <point>(1,1)</point>
    <line/>
</graph>
```

### Puzzle 2: Circle with inscribed polygon
Edit the starter code below to create a [circle](circle.mdx) with radius $5$ on a graph. Inscribe a [regular polygon](regularPolygon.mdx) 
with any number of sides in this circle.

Bonus Challenge: Have the user specify the number of sides.

```doenet-editor-horiz
<graph>
    <circle/>
    <regularPolygon/>
</graph>
```
