# Quick Start

### Welcome to the **DoenetML** documentation! This page will provide you with some quick pointers to enable you to start creating content today! 

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info">
### You will learn:
* What components are in DoenetML and their basic syntax
* How to create text, math formulas, images, and external links for your lessons
* How to define mathematical objects for use in question posing
* How to quickly create basic questions using defined mathematical objects
* How to generate graphs with interactive geometry
* How to award credit for specific student interactions with graph geometry
* How to rapidly create activities with random variants

## Components: Definition and basic syntax

**Components** in DoenetML are the basic building blocks of the set of instructions the author provides to 
the what is known as the Doenet **core**. These instructions tell the **core** what content should be rendered (or displayed on the page to the viewer), as well as how that content should behave. 

## Creating text, math formulas, images, and external links

Text content in doenetML can be created using the component, for paragraphs of text, or 
the  component, which are analagous to string variables.
