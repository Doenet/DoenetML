# Quick Start Tutorial

### Writing Your First DoenetML Document
DoenetML is an easy way to author interactive math activities for the web. In the next few minutes this guide will show you how to make a math assessment that can give your students instant feedback.

Here is an example math question with a place for students to type in and check their answers. Go ahead and answer the question and check your work.

<DoenetML>
{`
Simplify
<math>3/3+3</math>
<answer symbolicEquality>4</answer>
`}
</DoenetML>

Now lets look at the DoenetML you need to write to make this question.

```html
Simplify
<math>3 / 3 + 3</math>
<answer symbolicEquality>4</answer>
```
Test code [here](https://www.doenet.org/portfolioeditor/_J1J2N530LyIvVWx64xB8V/_AgzWwqGV6Yy9DfqMyGlFm).

### Markup Languages
DoenetML documents are written in plain text; the language is similar to HTML. The parts of the document that are written like `<math>` and `<answer>` are called *tags*. Tags allow you to create everything in your document that isn't just regular written text. Just like HTML, tags are denoted with angle brackets, `<` and `>`. The closing tag includes an extra slash.

Note that the DoenetML code is written on 3 lines, but the rendered version of the question is shown all on 1 line. It can be helpful to break up complex parts of your document onto separate lines to make the code easier to read, and by default this won't move your content onto a new line. If you want to make a new line in the document you can put some of the content in a paragraph `<p>` tag.


<Callout type="info">
All of code examples in this tutorial have a link to a two panel editor below. You can copy the code into the right-hand side of the editor, and click the "Update" button on the right hand side to see the results. Try editing the code above to put the answer box on its own line after the expression.
