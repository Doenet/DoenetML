# All about Points

Now that you can create `<graph>` objects in DoenetML, it's time to learn how to add various geometric objects to your graph. In later sections we'll cover lines, polygons, circles, and more, but we'll start simple, with points. That's because, even though they're relatively straightforward in DoenetML, many of the attributes and options with points will carry over to more complicated objects.

### Points in DoenetML
In DoenetML, a point is defined using the `<point>` tag. By default, a point will be located at $(0,0)$, but you can define its coordinates in many different ways, including:

* specifying an ordered pair of numbers between `<point>` and `</point>` tags.
* setting the coords attribute equal to an ordered pair of numbers.
* specifying the horizontal and vertical coordinates separately using the x and y attributes.
  
You can graph a point by including it inside of `<graph>` and `</graph>` tags. Alternatively, you can define a point within the regular text of your document, in which case Doenet will render its coordinates. If you want to define a point outside of a `<graph>` component, but don't want the coordinates displayed, you can place the definition in a setup block. Even if you create a point outside of a `<graph>` component, you can still display it within a graph by referencing it with `$pointName`.

The following example illustrates everything we've discussed so far about points. In the test editor, try changing some of the coordinates and clicking update to make sure you understand the definitions.

```html
<setup>
  <point name="A">(-8,2)</point>
</setup>

<m>B = </m> <point name="B" coords="(6,6)" />

<graph showNavigation="false">
  $A
  $B
  <point x="4" y="-4" />
</graph>
```
Test code [here](https://www.doenet.org/portfolioeditor/_J1J2N530LyIvVWx64xB8V/_AgzWwqGV6Yy9DfqMyGlFm).

By default, points can be dragged around, which updates their coordinates throughout your document. In particular: if you move the second point, $B$, its coordinates are updated above the graph.

A key feature of DoenetML is that these kinds of updates are *bidrectional*, as demonstrated below. In the following example, you can use the `<mathInput/>` to adjust the coordinates of $P$, and the point will move. But if you drag $P$ to a new location in the graph, the contents of the `<mathInput/>` object will also update!

```html
<p>
  <m>P = </m> 
  <mathInput name="Pcoords" 
             prefill="(4,2)" 
             displayDigits="3" />
</p>

<graph showNavigation="false" size="small">
  <point>$Pcoords</point>
</graph>
```
Test code [here](https://www.doenet.org/portfolioeditor/_J1J2N530LyIvVWx64xB8V/_AgzWwqGV6Yy9DfqMyGlFm).

You can see another neat feature of Doenet in the above example, although it's more relevant when using Doenet activities than authoring them. Use the input box to change the coordinates of $P$ to something which is outside of the grid -- say, $(20,2)$. The point will disappear, but Doenet will draw a small arrow on the side of the graph to let you know there's a point beyond the border. You can click and drag on that arrow to bring $P$ back into view! (If you don't want those arrows when a point is off-screen, you can include the `hideOffGraphIndicator` attribute in the definition of your point.)

### Point Labels
Similar to `<slider> `and `<graph>` objects, you can provide a label for a point with a nested `<label>` tag. Labels are placed above and to the right of a point, but you can adjust the location using the `labelPosition` attribute. The valid positions are: `top`, `left`, `right`, `bottom`, `upperleft`, `upperright`, `lowerleft`, and `lowerright`.

Often, you want the name and label of your point to be the same. To avoid the hassle of typing nested tags,
```html
     <point name="P" coords="(4,5)"><label>P</label></point>
```

DoenetML provides a shortcut attribute called `labelIsName` which uses the name of the point as its label:
```html
<graph showNavigation="false">
  
  <point name="A" labelPosition="right" labelIsName>
    (-8,2)
    <label><m>A</m></label>
  </point>

  <point name="B" coords="(6,6)" labelIsName />
  
  <point x="4" y="-4" labelPosition="lowerleft">
    <label>C</label>
  </point>
  
</graph>
```
Test code [here](https://www.doenet.org/portfolioeditor/_J1J2N530LyIvVWx64xB8V/_AgzWwqGV6Yy9DfqMyGlFm).

Labels are printed in plain text, unless you use `<m>` or `<math>` inside of a `<label>` child. If you look carefully at the three points above, you'll notice that $A$ was rendered with MathJax, in a different font than $B$ and $C$.

### Style Points
Earlier, you learned how to use `styleNumber` to distinguish between function graphs. The `styleNumber` attribute can be used with essentially any geometric object inside of a `<graph>` component, including points; when applied to a `<point>` object, `styleNumber` will not only change the color, but also the shape of a point. Here are points rendered with `styleNumber="n"` for $n \in \{1,2, \dots , 6\}$.

<DoenetMLExample>
{`
<graph xmin="0" xmax="7" ymin="-1" ymax="1" 
           showNavigation="false" identicalAxisScales
           displayXAxis="false" displayYAxis="false" >  

      <map>
        <template><point labelPosition="bottom" styleNumber="$i">
          ($i,0)
          <label>$i</label>
        </point></template>
        <sources alias="i"><sequence from="1" to="6" /></sources>
      </map>

    </graph>
`}
</DoenetMLExample>

Before continuing, try adjusting the `styleNumber` of a point in one of the examples above. Click "update" and make sure the point's style changes.

### Point Arithmetic
DoenetML supports some basic arithmetic operations with points, essentially treating them like vectors. By combining scalar multiplication and addition, you can easily find and plot the midpoint of two points. (Normally we'd refer to the midpoint of a line segment, but we haven't learned how to graph line segments yet!)

*Reminder: In DoenetML you can refer to an object before it is defined, as long as it is defined somewhere in your document. In the following code, the computations with $P$ and $Q$ are done at the beginning, even though those points are defined in the `<graph>` below.*

```html
<p><m>3\cdot P = 
  <math simplify>3*$P</math></m>
</p>

<p><m>P + Q = 
  <math simplify>$P+$Q</math></m>
</p>

<p><m>\dfrac{P+Q}{2} = 
  <math simplify name="midpt">(1/2)*($P+$Q)</math></m></p>

<graph showNavigation="false" size="small"
       xmin="-1" ymin="-1">

  <point name="P" coords="(2,8)" labelIsName />
  <point name="Q" coords="(6,3)" labelIsName />

  <point name="M" styleNumber="2" coords="$midpt">
    <label><m>M = \frac{P+Q}{2}</m></label>
  </point>        
        
</graph>
```
Test code [here](https://www.doenet.org/portfolioeditor/_J1J2N530LyIvVWx64xB8V/_AgzWwqGV6Yy9DfqMyGlFm).

Notice that you can drag $P$ and $Q$ around in the graph, and everything else updates appropriately. However, you can't click on the midpoint $M$ and drag it around. That's because it's a *dependent* object; in other words, its coordinates depend on both $P$ and $Q$. Changing $M$ would require changing $P$, or $Q$, or both. Since Doenet isn't sure which of those three options you want, it doesn't let you move $M$ at all.

Now go back and add the attribute `fixed` to the definition of $Q$,
```html
<point name="Q" coords="(6,3)" labelisName fixed/>
```

and then click "update." As you can guess, the `fixed` attribute tells Doenet that the coordinates of $Q$ are fixed, i.e. can't be changed by the user. Verify that you can drag $P$ but not $Q$. Here's the surprise: you can now click and drag on the midpoint $M$-- try it to be sure! Now that $Q$ is fixed, Doenet knows the only way $M$ can change is if $P$ moves, so it will go ahead and make that change when you drag the midpoint.

### Next Steps
In the next section, we'll move up from points to line segments, rays, and lines. Then we'll learn about so-called "properties" in Doenet, before moving on to more complicated shapes like polygons.
