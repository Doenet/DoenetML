# Writing DoenetML in VS Code

## Recommended Workflow
1. In VS Code, click on the Extensions icon in the left panel. 
2. Search for "DoenetML" in the Extensions Marketplace search bar that opens.
3. Install the DoenetML extension
4. Open a new file in VS Code and save it with the extension `.doenetml`.
5. Once you begin entering doenetML content, a button to "Preview Doenet" will 
appear in the top right corner of the screen.
6. Click the button to open a preview of your DoenetML content in a new tab.


**Note:** Dark mode is still under development in Doenet.
Therefore, it is recommended to use the light mode in VS Code when authoring DoenetML content.
