# Setup Blocks

You might have noticed on previous pages that, every time we defined a `<math>` or `<number>` object, the value was displayed on screen. You can avoid that by using the `<setup>` tag; anything between `<setup>` and `</setup>` will be defined and available to use throughout your document, but will not be displayed on screen.

In the following example, the numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$ are defined as `<math>` objects; then they're used to compute the discriminant 
$b^2 - 4 a c$
. None of those definitions and computation are displayed on screen, but all four numbers are used later on.

```html {1,9}
<setup>  
  <math name="a">2</math>
  <math name="b">8</math>
  <math name="c">6</math>

  <math name="discr" simplify>
    $b^2 - 4*$a*$c
  </math>
</setup>

<p>Equation: <m><math simplify>
  $a*x^2+$b*x+$c
</math> = 0</m></p>

<p>Discriminant: $discr</p>
```
Test code [here](https://www.doenet.org/portfolioeditor/_J1J2N530LyIvVWx64xB8V/_AgzWwqGV6Yy9DfqMyGlFm).

For comparison, here's the same code with `<setup>` and `</setup>` removed. The four numbers from the `<setup>` block are all displayed on screen, which is confusing to the user!

```html
<math name="a">2</math>
<math name="b">8</math>
<math name="c">6</math>

<math name="discr" simplify>
    $b^2 - 4*$a*$c
</math>

<p>Equation: <m><math simplify>
  $a*x^2+$b*x+$c
</math> = 0</m></p>

<p>Discriminant: $discr</p>
```
Test code [here](https://www.doenet.org/portfolioeditor/_J1J2N530LyIvVWx64xB8V/_AgzWwqGV6Yy9DfqMyGlFm).

Throughout the rest of this tutorial, we'll frequently use `<setup>` for definitions and computations that don't need to appear on screen.

### Next Steps
It's time to make our documents interactive! In the next section we'll learn the basics of how to get user input in a DoenetML document.
