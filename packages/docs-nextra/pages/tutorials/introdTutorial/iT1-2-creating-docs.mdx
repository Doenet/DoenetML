# Creating Your own Doenet Documents

Now that you know the basics of writing in DoenetML, you're ready to create your own Doenet documents. That way you can save your work and create public pages that other people can view. You can also create your own documents to experiment as you read through this tutorial.

### Creating a Doenet Account
Creating an account is fast and easy! To begin, go to [doenet.org](https://www.doenet.org/#/home) and click the "Sign In" button in the corner.



Next, enter the email address you'd like to use for your account. If you're using your own private computer, we suggest clicking the "Stay Logged In" button so that the site automatically remembers you.



After clicking the "Send Email" button, check the email account that you just entered; you should receive an email from the Doenet server with a 9-digit access code. Enter that code on screen and you'll be logged in!



The first time you log in, Doenet will ask for your first and last name.

**Note:** If you want to log in again (say, from a different computer, or using a different browser), you'll go through the same process: enter your email address, and wait for a 9-digit access code.

### Creating a Doenet Document
Once you're logged in, go to the Doenet homepage and click Portfolio.

At first your portfolio will be empty, but you can click on "Add Activity" to create a document.

Now you'll see an editor on the right, where you can type DoenetML code. Click "Update" in the upper left to display your text and mathematics on the left.

Other buttons and options in this view include:

* Click "View" to see your document without the editor; click "Edit" to return to the side-by-side view.

* Click "Untitled Activity" to change the name of your document.

* Click "Documentation" to see documentation, including tutorials and reference material.

* Click "Controls" to access the Activity Controls. in particular, when you're ready to share your document with others, go to these controls and click "Public" next to "Visbility." (See below.) Once an activity is visible, other users can find it by searching on the "Community" tab on the Doenet homepage. You can also search for your own activity from the Community tab, open the page, and then copy the URL of your public document from your web browser to share with others.



### Next Steps
At this point you have all the skills you need to create and share pages full of text and mathematics! In the rest of the tutorial, you'll learn you how to make your documents interactive.
