# Domains, Derivatives, and Variables

In this section we'll explore additional options and operations with functions in DoenetML. We'll begin with domains!

### Specifying the Domain of a Function

So far the functions we've used have been defined for all real numbers. If you want to restrict the domain of a function, you can use the domain attribute in the `<function>` tag. Any attempt to evaluate the function outside of its specified domain will return an empty result. In the example below, this happens for $f(3)$
