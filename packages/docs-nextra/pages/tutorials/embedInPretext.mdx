# How to Embed your DoenetML in a PreTeXt book

## Recommended Workflow
To start, we assume that you have a PreTeXt book already created. If you don't, you can 
create one by following the instructions in the [PreTeXt Getting Started Guide](https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/tutorial.html).

1. Create your DoenetML content in the Doenet editor on the [Doenet website](https://alpha.doenet.org/), 
    *or* author content alongside your PreTeXt source in VS Code with the [DoenetML extension](vsCodeExtension.mdx)
2. If authoring in the Doenet editor, copy the DoenetML text and paste it into an empty file in the relevant directory of your PreTeXt book. 
    Name this file with the format `filename.doenetml`.
3. If using the VS Code extension, save your doenetML source file in your PreTeXt book with the extension `filename.doenetml` 
5. In the PreTeXt file in which you want to embed the DoenetML (this is most likely a section file with the `.ptx` extension), add the following code:

```xml
<interactive label="interactive-label" platform="doenetml" width="100%" aspect="2:8">
  <slate surface="doenetml">
    <xi:include parse="text" href="filename.doenetml"/> 
  </slate>
</interactive>
```
Note, this code is a PreTeXt snippet. The `xi:include` tag is used to include the DoenetML file in the PreTeXt book. The `@aspect` 
attribute is used to set the aspect ratio of the DoenetML content - you may need to experiment with this to get the desired size for 
your doenetML content.
