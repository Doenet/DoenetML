# ` <hint>{:dn}`



` <hint>{:dn}` is a [Sectional](../document_structure/essentialConcepts#component-types)
component that renders a hidden block of content that can be expanded when its banner is clicked 
or can be rendered visible only when triggered by specific user interactions.


## Attributes and Properties 
The ` <hint>{:dn}` does not have attributes.
 <PropDisplay name='hint'/>



---

### Example: ` <hint>{:dn}` that is always visible


```doenet-example
<p>What food item below was NOT invented in America?
  <answer>
    <choice>Hot Dogs</choice>
    <choice>Cotton Candy</choice>
    <choice credit="1">Pizza</choice>
  </answer>
</p>
<hint>According to popular belief, both Hot
  Dogs and Cotton Candy were invented at the
  1904 World's Fair in St. Louis.
</hint> 
```

The ` <hint>{:dn}` banner is not triggered by any specific conditions and 
is always accessible to the user. The content of the ` <hint>{:dn}` is made 
available by clicking on the hint banner. 

---

### Example: ` <hint>{:dn}` only visible for specified interactions


```doenet-editor-horiz
<p>What is the smallest prime number?
  <answer name="ans1">2</answer>
    <hint hide="$ans1 != 1">
      By convention the number 1 is not prime.  Try again!
    </hint>
</p>
```



The conditions under which a ` <hint>{:dn}` is visible can be tailored to 
specific user interactions using the ` <hide>{:dn}` attribute.



---

### Example: Hide a ` <hint>{:dn}` until user answers twice


```doenet-editor-horiz
<p>Given the line <math>y = 1/2 x - 4</math>, 
what is the <m>y</m>-intercept?
  <answer name="ans">-4</answer>

  <hint 
    hide="($ans.nSubmissions < 2) or ($ans.creditAchieved = 1)">
    Think of the slope-intercept form of a line: <m>y = mx + b</m>
  </hint>
</p>
```

Properties of the named ` <answer>{:dn}` component are referenced by the 
boolean condition listed in the `hide` attribute of the ` <hint>{:dn}`. In 
this case, if the user answers incorrectly 2 or more times, the `hide` attribute 
of the ` <hint>{:dn}` will become `false`, and the ` <hint>{:dn}` will appear.

---

### Property Example: open


```doenet-editor-horiz
<p>Open and close the hint.</p>

<hint name="myHint">Here is a tip.</hint>

<p><c>open</c> = $myHint.open</p>
```



The `open` property renders the boolean value corresponding to whether 
the ` <hint>{:dn}` is currently open.



---

### Property Example: title


```doenet-editor-horiz
<hint name="myHint"><title>Top Secret</title>
  Here is a tip.</hint>

<p><c>title</c> = $myHint.title</p>
```



The `title` property renders the title associated with the ` <hint>{:dn}`.
