# ` <pre>{:dn}`


The ` <pre>{:dn}` component renders a block of text that preserves the formatting of the text directly as input into the editor, including line spacing, font and indentation.

## Attributes and Properties 
 <AttrDisplay name='pre'/> 
 <PropDisplay name='pre'/>

---

### Example: Using ` <pre>{:dn}` to modify default spacing


```doenet-editor-horiz
<pre>
            A world of dew,
          And within every dewdrop
            A world of struggle.
                      -Kobayashi Issa
</pre>
```



The ` <pre>{:dn}` component is used to precisely
space the lines of a Haiku as they are typed in the editor.
