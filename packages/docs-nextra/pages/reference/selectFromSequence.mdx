# ` <selectFromSequence>{:dn}`


` <selectFromSequence>{:dn}` is a [Math](../document_structure/essentialConcepts#component-types)
component that creates named variants from a user-defined range of numerical (or alphabetical) values. Selections generate variants of the document.

## Attributes and Properties 
 <AttrDisplay name='selectFromSequence'/> 
 <PropDisplay name='selectFromSequence'/>

---

### Example: Default ` <selectFromSequence>{:dn}`


```doenet-editor-horiz
<selectFromSequence/>
<selectFromSequence/>
<selectFromSequence/>
```



The default ` <selectFromSequence>{:dn}` has a sequence range from $1$ to $10$.

Select a new page variant from the pulldown menu at the top of the 
editor to see different variants of the document.

---

### Example: Generate multiple selections


```doenet-editor-horiz
<selectFromSequence 
  name="x" 
  from="-5" 
  to="5" 
  step="0.5" 
  numToSelect="3"
/>

<me>x_1 = $x[1]</me>
<me>x_2 = $x[2]</me>
<me>x_3 = $x[3]</me>  
```


Three numbers are selected between -5 and 5 (stepping in increments of 0.5). Individual
selections can be accessed using array notation.

Select a new page variant from the pulldown menu at the top of the 
editor to see different variants of the document.

### Example: Assign descriptive names to selections


```doenet-editor-horiz
<setup>
<selectFromSequence 
  name="coeff" 
  from="-5" 
  to="5" 
  exclude="0" 
  numToSelect="3"
/>
<number name="a" extend="$coeff[1]"/>
<number name="b" extend="$coeff[2]"/>
<number name="c" extend="$coeff[3]"/>

<math name="expr" simplify="numbersPreserveOrder">
  $a x^2 + $b x + $c
</math>
</setup>

<me>y = $expr</me>
```



Three numbers are selected between -5 and 5 (stepping in increments of 0.5). 
Selections can be assigned more descriptive names by defining individual components
which reference the selected values.

### Attribute Example: numToSelect


```doenet-editor-horiz
<selectFromSequence 
  name="s" from="0" 
  to="50" 
  numToSelect="5"
/>

<p>The first selection is <c>s[1]</c> = $s[1]</p>
```



The `numToSelect` attribute allows for selection of multiple values within the range of a 
single ` <selectFromSequence>{:dn}` component. Multiple selections are made without replacement, unless
the `withReplacement` attribute is also specified.

Select a new page variant from the pulldown menu at the top of the 
editor to see different variants of the document.

### Attribute Example: sortResults


```doenet-editor-horiz
<selectFromSequence 
  name="s" 
  sortResults 
  from="0" 
  to="50" 
  numToSelect="5"
/>

<p>The first selection is <c>s[1]</c> = $s[1]</p>
<p>The second selection is <c>s[2]</c> = $s[2]</p>
<p>The third selection is <c>s[3]</c> = $s[3]</p>
<p>The fourth selection is <c>s[4]</c> = $s[4]</p>
<p>The fifth selection is <c>s[5]</c> = $s[5]</p>
```



The `sortResults` attribute sorts the selected results in increasing order.

Select a new page variant from the pulldown menu at the top of the 
editor to see different variants of the document.


---

### Attribute Example: from, to


```doenet-editor-horiz
<selectFromSequence 
  name="s" 
  from="10" 
  to="20" 
  numToSelect="4"
/>

<p>The third selection is <c>s[3]</c> = $s[3]</p>
```



The `from` and `to` attributes specify the endpoints of the selection interval.

editor to see different variants of the document.


---

### Attribute Example: step


```doenet-editor-horiz
<selectFromSequence 
  name="s" 
  from="10" 
  to="20" 
  step="2"
  numToSelect="4"
/>

<p>The third selection is <c>s[3]</c> = $s[3]</p>
```

The `step` attribute specifies the size of each increment in the sequence. The default `step` is $1$

editor to see different variants of the document.

### Attribute Example: exclude


```doenet-editor-horiz
<selectFromSequence 
  name="s" 
  from="-5" 
  to="5" 
  exclude="0"
  numToSelect="10"
/>

<p>The third selection is <c>s[3]</c> = $s[3]</p>
```


The `exclude` attribute specifies values to exclude in the selection.

Select a new page variant from the pulldown menu at the top of the 
editor to see different variants of the document.

### Attribute Example: withReplacement


```doenet-editor-horiz
<selectFromSequence 
  name="s" 
  from="-1" 
  to="1" 
  withReplacement
  numToSelect="10"
/>

<p>The third selection is <c>s[3]</c> = $s[3]</p>
```



If selection with replacement is the desired behavior, use the `withReplacement` attribute.

editor to see different variants of the document.

### Attribute Example: excludeCombinations


```doenet-editor-horiz
<selectFromSequence 
  name="s" 
  exclude="0" 
  numToSelect="2"  
  from="-3" 
  to="3" 
  excludecombinations="(-3 3) (3 -3) (-2 2) (2 -2) (-1 1) (1 -1)" 
/>

<p><math simplify>$s[1] x + $s[2] x</math></p>       
```


The `excludeCombinations` attribute can be used to exclude unfavorable combinations of 
parameters. In this example, the exclusions have been designed to prevent the condition 
that the coefficients in the expression result in a sum of $0$.

### Attribute Example: type


```doenet-editor-horiz
<selectFromSequence
  name="alpha" 
  type="letters" 
  from="a" 
  to="g" 
  numToSelect="5" 
/>

<p>The third selection is <c>alpha[3]</c> = $alpha[3]</p>    
```



The `type` attribute takes either `letters` or `number` as a text input. If unspecified, 
the default `type` is `number`.
