# ` <matchesPattern>{:dn}`

` <matchesPattern>{:dn}` returns the boolean value of `true` or `false` depending on whether the enclosed math (often a referenced ` <mathInput/>{:dn}`) conforms to the specified `pattern` template.

## Attributes and Properties 
 <AttrDisplay name='matchesPattern'/> 
 <PropDisplay name='matchesPattern'/>

### Example: basic use


```doenet-editor-horiz
<p>Enter an equation in slope-intercept form: <mathInput name="mi"/></p>
<p>Format correct: </p>
<matchesPattern pattern="y = ()x + ()" >
  $mi
</matchesPattern>   
```



The ` <matchesPattern>{:dn}` component is used to check that the user has supplied an equation in the requested format. The `pattern` attribute is required. If used without additional attributes as shown above, a rather strict comparison occurs. In order to evaluate to `true`, the entered expression must:


* have a $y$ on the left side, and an $x$ on the other, and no other variables can be present
* have at least one constant term on the right-hand side
* the $x$ value must have a numerical coefficient (even if it is $1$)
* switching the order of terms on the right-hand side is acceptable





These requirements may be relaxed, if desired, by applying additional attributes to ` <matchesPattern>{:dn}`, or by including multiple accepted patterns within answer evaluation.
