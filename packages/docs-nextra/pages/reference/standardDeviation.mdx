# ` <standardDeviation>{:dn}`

` <standardDeviation>{:dn}` is a [Math Operator](../document_structure/essentialConcepts/#componentTypes) 
component that renders the standard deviation of a list of enclosed data values according to the equation: 


$$\sigma(x) = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_{i} - \bar x)^2}{n-1}}$$


In this equation, $\bar x$ 
represents the mean of the sample and $n$ the number of data points.  By default, the sample 
standard deviation is calculated.  If instead, the `population` attribute is specified as "true", the
 equation becomes: 
 
 
$$\sigma(x) = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_{i} - \bar x)^2}{n}}$$

### Example: ` <standardDeviation>{:dn}` of a list of numbers


```doenet-editor-horiz
<p><m>A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, -1\}</m></p>
<p>The standard deviation of <m>A</m> is <standardDeviation>
  1 2 3 4 -1
</standardDeviation>
</p>         
```



The ` <standardDeviation>{:dn}` component is used without any additional attributes. 
Data is directly entered in the form of a list of numbers separated by spaces within the opening and closing tags.

### Attribute Example: population


```doenet-editor-horiz
<p><m>A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, -1\} </m></p>
<p>The population standardDeviation of <m>A</m> is 
<standardDeviation population="true">
    1 2 3 4 -1
</standardDeviation>
</p>   
```



The ` <standardDeviation>{:dn}` component is used with the `population` attribute and the population standard deviation is calculated according 
the second equation shown above.
