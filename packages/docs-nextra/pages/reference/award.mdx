# ` <award>{:dn}`

## Basic Use Examples

` <award>{:dn}` is 
an [Evaluation](../document_structure/essentialConcepts#component-types) component 
that defines conditions for awarding credit and 
evaluating user responses.  An ` <award>{:dn}` is the child of 
an [` <answer>{:dn}`](answer1.mdx) and can be used to refine credit awarded 
in a variety of applications.

Many attributes for ` <answer>{:dn}` can be applied to an ` <award>{:dn}` to 
control the behavior of just that ` <award>{:dn}`.

The following examples illustrate some of the basic award forms.  
See the following pages for additional examples on using the attributes and properties.

## Attributes and Properties 
 <AttrDisplay name='award'/> 
 <PropDisplay name='award'/>


---

### Example: ` <award>{:dn}` multiple correct responses


```doenet-example
<p><m>\sqrt{4} = </m>
  <answer>
    <award>2</award>
    <award>-2</award>
  </answer>
</p>   
```



 Multiple ` <award>{:dn}` children can be used within an [` <answer>{:dn}`](answer1.mdx) to ascribe 
 credit to multiple responses.



---

### Example: ` <award>{:dn}` based on a boolean


```doenet-example
<p>Enter a number greater than 2:
  <answer>
    <mathInput name="input1"/>
    <award>
      <when>$input1 > 2</when>
    </award>
  </answer>
</p>
```



An ` <answer>{:dn}` can be based on a boolean condition by giving each ` <award>{:dn}` a
[` <when>{:dn}`](when.mdx)
child.  An ` <award>{:dn}` will be awarded if its ` <when>{:dn}` evaluates to `true`.



---

### Example: ` <award>{:dn}` for partial credit


```doenet-example
<p><em>For the following question, first enter <m>\frac{4}{8}</m> and 
then <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>.</em></p>

<p>Question: Simplify <m>\frac{8}{16}</m>
<answer symbolicEquality>
  <award>1/2</award>
  <award credit="0.5">4/8</award>
</answer>
</p>
```



The `credit` attribute of the ` <award>{:dn}` component is used to assign partial credit to specific responses.



---

### Example: ` <award>{:dn}` for tailored feedback


```doenet-example
<p><em>For the following question, first enter <m>\frac{4}{8}</m> 
and then <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>.</em></p>

<p>Question: Simplify <m>\frac{8}{16}</m>
  <answer symbolicEquality>
    <award>1/2</award>
    <award name="notFully" credit="0">4/8</award>
  </answer>
</p>

<feedback condition="$notFully">Simplify further.</feedback>
```



A named ` <award>{:dn}` can be referenced within a ` <feedback>{:dn}` to target specific responses.
