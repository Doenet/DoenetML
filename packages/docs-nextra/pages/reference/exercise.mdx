# ` <exercise>{:dn}`


` <exercise>{:dn}` is a [Sectional](../document_structure/essentialConcepts#component-types) 
component that renders an auto-numbered block of content. Inline components such as 
paragraphs (` <p>{:dn}`) and other components can be nested within an ` <exercise>{:dn}` to group 
and order content. Some examples are: another ` <exercise>{:dn}`, a ` <section>{:dn}`, 
a ` <figure>{:dn}`, or a ` <problem>{:dn}`.


## Attributes and Properties 
 <AttrDisplay name='exercise'/> 
 <PropDisplay name='exercise'/>

---

### Example: ` <exercise>{:dn}` with default title


```doenet-editor-horiz
<exercise>
  <p>An exploratory exercise.</p>
</exercise>

<section>
  <p><lorem generateWords="10"/></p>
</section>

<problem>
  <p><answer>42</answer></p>
</problem>
```



Within a DoenetML document, default titles for sectional components are auto-numbered. 
Each sectional component is on the same counter.



---

### Example: ` <exercise>{:dn}` with custom title


```doenet-example
<exercise><title>Build a water rocket</title>
  <p><lorem generateWords="10"/></p>
</exercise>
```



A custom ` <exercise>{:dn}` title is creating by 
providing a ` <title>{:dn}` tag within the ` <exercise>{:dn}`.



---

### Example: Nesting sectional components


```doenet-example
<exercise><title>This is the main exercise.</title>
  <p><lorem generateWords="10"/></p>

  <example>
    <p><lorem generateWords="10"/></p>
  </example>

</exercise>
```



A hierarchy is created by nesting one or more sectional components within an ` <exercise>{:dn}`.



---

### Example: Named ` <exercise>{:dn}` as a parent reference


```doenet-editor-horiz
<exercise name="ex1" boxed>
  <number name="x">sqrt(2)</number>  
  <p><m>x = $x</m></p>
</exercise>

<exercise name="ex2" boxed>
  <number name="x">3/4</number>  
  <p><m>x = $x</m></p>
</exercise>  

<p>From first exercise: 
  <m>x_1 = $ex1.x </m></p>
<p>From second exercise: 
  <m>x_2 = $ex2.x </m></p>
```

When reference names are used more than once in the same document,
they can be distinguished (when outside their parent component) by 
attaching the name of the parent component to the reference.

Above, the ` <exercise>{:dn}` named `ex1` is the
parent of the `<number>{:dn}` named `x`. Therefore, when 
referencing this specific instance of the component with that name, 
you should use `$ex1.x` as shown.

### Attribute Example: includeParentNumber


```doenet-editor-horiz
<section boxed>
  <exercise>
    <p>This exercise is nested inside a section. The default number does not include the parent number.</p>
  </exercise>
</section>

<section boxed>
  <exercise includeParentNumber="true">
    <p>This exercise is nested inside a section. Rendering of the parent section number has been included.</p>
  </exercise>
</section>
```



The `includeParentNumber` attribute is `false` by default for the ` <exercise>{:dn}` component 
(and `true` by default for the ` <section>{:dn}` component).


In order to include the number of the parent sectional component, set `includeParentNumber` to `true`.



---

### Attribute Example: includeAutoNumber


```doenet-editor-horiz
<exercise boxed><title>Custom title</title>
  <p>In this exercise, the custom title overrides the default numbering of the exercise.</p>
</exercise>

<exercise boxed includeAutoNumber="true"><title>Special title</title>
  <p>In this exercise, the number of the exercise is still rendered in addition to the custom title.</p>
</exercise>
```



The `includeAutoNumber` attribute is `false` by default for the ` <exercise>{:dn}` component. 
This means that if an exercise contains a nested ` <title>{:dn}`, it will not render the default 
numbering (although it will still be counted in the numbering scheme behind the scenes).

In order to display the exercise number in addition to the custom ` <title>{:dn}`, set 
the `includeAutoNumber` attribute to `true`.



---

### Attribute Example: sectionWideCheckWork


```doenet-example
<exercise sectionWideCheckWork><title>Multiple questions</title>
  <p>Enter <m>x</m>: <answer>x</answer></p>
  <p>Enter <m>y</m>: <answer>y</answer></p>
  <p>Enter <m>z</m>: <answer>z</answer></p>
</exercise>
```



The `sectionWideCheckWork` attribute combines validation 
for all ` <answer>{:dn}` components within the ` <exercise>{:dn}` under a single "Check Work" button.


---

### Attribute Example: forceIndividualAnswerColoring


```doenet-example
<exercise sectionWideCheckWork forceIndividualAnswerColoring><title>Multiple questions</title>
  <p>Enter <m>x</m>: <answer>x</answer></p>
  <p>Enter <m>y</m>: <answer>y</answer></p>
  <p>Enter <m>z</m>: <answer>z</answer></p>
</exercise>
```

Typically, the `sectionWideCheckWork` attribute causes all answer box border colors
to correspond to the overall correctness of the entire exercise
(i.e., the colors don't reveal additional information about which answer is correct).
If `forceIndividualAnswerColoring` is also specified, then each answer box border
will instead be colored according to its own answer's correctness.



---

### Attribute Example: boxed


```doenet-example
<exercise boxed><title>Boxed exercise</title>
  <p><lorem generateWords="10"/></p>
</exercise>
```



The `boxed` attribute changes the default formatting for a sectional 
component to one that has a border and a shaded banner for the title.



---

### Attribute Example: hide


```doenet-editor-horiz
<booleanInput name="hideExercise">
  <label>Click here to hide the exercise</label>
</booleanInput>

<exercise hide="$hideExercise"><title>Now you see me...</title>
  <p><lorem generateWords="10"/></p>
</exercise>
```



The `hide` attribute takes a boolean as input and can be used with any rendered component.
