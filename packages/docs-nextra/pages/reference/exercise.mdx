# ` <exercise>{:dn}`


` <exercise>{:dn}` renders an auto-numbered block of content. Inline components such as paragraphs (` <p>{:dn}`) and other components can be nested within an ` <exercise>{:dn}` to group and order content. Some examples are: another ` <exercise>{:dn}`, a ` <section>{:dn}`, a [` <figure>{:dn}`](figure.mdx), or a [` <problem>{:dn}`](problem.mdx).


## Attributes and Properties 
 <AttrDisplay name='exercise'/> 
 <PropDisplay name='exercise'/>

---

### Example: ` <exercise>{:dn}` with default title


```doenet-editor-horiz
<exercise>
  <p>An exploratory exercise.</p>
</exercise>
<section>
  <p><lorem generateWords="10"/></p>
</section>
<problem>
  <p><answer>42</answer></p>
</problem>
```



Within a DoenetML document, default titles for sectional components are auto-numbered. Each sectional component is on the same counter.



---

### Example: ` <exercise>{:dn}` with custom title


```doenet-editor-horiz
<exercise><title>Build a water rocket</title>
  <p><lorem generateWords="10"/></p>
</exercise>
```



A custom ` <exercise>{:dn}` title is creating by providing a ` <title>{:dn}` tag within the ` <exercise>{:dn}`.



---

### Example: Nesting sectional components


```doenet-editor-horiz
<exercise><title>This is the main exercise.</title>
  <p><lorem generateWords="10"/></p>

---

    <p><lorem generateWords="10"/></p>


</exercise>
```



A hierarchy is created by nesting one or more sectional components within an ` <exercise>{:dn}`.



---

### Example: newNameSpace


```doenet-editor-horiz
<exercise boxed>
  <p>This is the same namespace as the larger document.</p>
  <number name="x">sqrt(2)</number>  
  <p><m>x = $x</m></p>
</exercise>
<exercise newNameSpace name="secondExercise" boxed>
  <p>This is a separate, distinct namespace.</p>
  <number name="x">3/4</number>  
  <p><m>x = $x</m></p>
</exercise>  
<p>General document: <m>x = $x</m></p>
<p>Second example: <m>x</m> = $(secondExercise/x)</p>
```



The `newNameSpace` attribute defines a separate namespace within the sectional component. Values corresponding to that namespace can be accessed outside the namespace by prepending the name of the exercise.



---

### Example: includeParentNumber


```doenet-editor-horiz
<section boxed>
  <exercise>
    <p>This exercise is nested inside a section. The default number does not include the parent number.</p>
  </exercise>
</section>
<section boxed>
  <exercise includeParentNumber="true">
    <p>This exercise is nested inside a section. Rendering of the parent section number has been included.</p>
  </exercise>
</section>
```



The `includeParentNumber` attribute is `false` by default for the ` <exercise>{:dn}` component (and `true` by default for the ` <section>{:dn}` component).


In order to include the number of the parent sectional component, set `includeParentNumber` to `true`.



---

### Example: includeAutoNumber


```doenet-editor-horiz
  <exercise boxed><title>Custom title</title>
    <p>In this exercise, the custom title overrides the default numbering of the exercise.</p>
  </exercise>
  <exercise boxed includeAutoNumber="true">
### Example: Special title

    <p>In this exercise, the number of the exercise is still rendered in addition to the custom title.</p>
  </exercise>
```



The `includeAutoNumber` attribute is `false` by default for the ` <exercise>{:dn}` component. This means that if an exercise contains a nested ` <title>{:dn}`, it will not render the default numbering (although it will still be counted in the numbering scheme behind the scenes).


In order to display the exercise number in addition to the custom ` <title>{:dn}`, set the `includeAutoNumber` attribute to `true`.



---

### Example: aggregateScores and sectionWideCheckWork


```doenet-editor-horiz
<exercise sectionWideCheckWork aggregateScores><title>Multiple questions</title>
  <p>Enter <m>x</m>: <answer>x</answer></p>
  <p>Enter <m>y</m>: <answer>y</answer></p>
  <p>Enter <m>z</m>: <answer>z</answer></p>
</exercise>
```



The `aggregateScores` and `sectionWideCheckWork` attributes together combine validation for all ` <answer>{:dn}` components within the ` <exercise>{:dn}` under a single "Check Work" button.



---

### Example: weight *


```doenet-editor-horiz
```



. 



---

### Example: boxed


```doenet-editor-horiz
<exercise boxed><title>Boxed exercise</title>
  <p><lorem generateWords="10"/></p>
</exercise>
```



The `boxed` attribute changes the default formatting for a sectional component to one that has a border and a shaded banner for the title.



---

### Example: hide


```doenet-editor-horiz
<booleanInput name="hideExercise">
  <label>Click here to hide the exercise</label>
</booleanInput>
<exercise hide="$hideExercise"><title>Now you see me...</title>
  <p><lorem generateWords="10"/></p>
</exercise>
```



The `hide` attribute takes a boolean as input and can be used with any rendered component.
