# ` <answer>{:dn}`

## Attribute Examples Part 1

The following examples illustrate use of the ` <answer>{:dn}` tag attributes.  

## Attributes
 <AttrDisplay name='answer'/> 

---

### Example: disabled
```doenet-example
  <p>Answer this to activate the next problem: 
    <m>2 - 1 = </m><answer name="ans1" symbolicEquality>1</answer></p>
  <p>Next problem: <m>$ans1.submittedResponse + 1 = </m>
    <answer name="ans2" disabled="$ans1.creditAchieved != 1" symbolicEquality>2</answer></p>
```



The condition within the `disabled` attribute is  `true` until the 
user achieves credit for the first ` <answer>{:dn}`.


The `symbolicEquality` attribute was added to prevent mathematical operations 
in the answer validation, so that, for example, `2-1` is not a correct 
answer to the first question.



---

### Example: weight
```doenet-example
  <document name="assignment">
    <p>Question 1 (important)</p>
    <p><m>1 + 1 = </m>
    <answer weight="2" name="ans1">2</answer></p>

    <p>Question 2 (less important)</p>
    <p><m>1 + 2 = </m>
    <answer name="ans2">3</answer></p>

    <p>Credit for question 1: $ans1.creditAchieved</p>
    <p>Credit for question 2: $ans2.creditAchieved</p>
    <p>Total credit for assignment: $assignment.creditAchieved</p>
  </document>
```

This example illustrates the use the `weight` attribute 
within an ` <answer>{:dn}`. Use `weight` to reduce or enhance the 
proportion of total credit on the page obtained for a correct response to a  
single ` <answer>{:dn}`. By default, each ` <answer>{:dn}` has an equal weight of $1$. 

---

### Example: inline
```doenet-example
<p>The complementary color for red is 
  <answer inline>
    <choice>blue</choice>
    <choice credit="1">green</choice>
    <choice>yellow</choice>
  </answer>.
</p>
<p>What is the complementary color for purple?
  <answer>
    <choice>blue</choice>
    <choice>green</choice>
    <choice credit="1">yellow</choice>
  </answer>
</p>
```

For a multiple choice question, the `inline` attribute causes the choices to displayed using an inline format.



---

### Example: handGraded
```doenet-example
<p>In one sentence, describe the theme of the story: 
  <answer type="text" handGraded expanded/>
</p>
```

The `handGraded` attribute is applied when auto-grading is not possible or 
preferred. The student's responses are stored for future grading.

---

### Example: matchPartial
```doenet-editor-horiz
<p>Enter an even number greater than 6:
  <answer matchPartial>
    <mathInput name="userNumber"/>
    <award>
      <when>$userNumber > 6 and <mod>$userNumber 2</mod> = 0</when>
    </award>
  </answer></p>

<p>What is <m>(1,2,3)+(4,5,6)</m>? <answer matchPartial>(5,7,9)</answer></p>
<p>Select all the warm colors:
  <answer matchPartial selectMultiple>
    <choice credit="1">yellow</choice>
    <choice>green</choice>
    <choice credit="1">orange</choice>
    <choice credit="1">red</choice>
    <choice>blue</choice>
  </answer></p>
```



When the `matchPartial` attribute is applied, an automated partial 
credit evaluation will be attempted, potentially giving credit between 0 and 1.  Without the `matchPartial` attribute, the response 
must be completely correct before it receives credit.


The automated partial credit algorithm will attempt to break up logical conditions into pieces, look 
separately at components of vectors, and award partially matched choices.


More fine grained control can be obtained by adding multiple ` <award>{:dn}` children to an ` <answer>{:dn}` and giving 
each ` <award>{:dn}` a different `credit` attribute.


For comparison of vectors, the attributes `matchByExactPositions` and `unorderedCompare` influence the partial credit algorithm.



---

### Example: symbolicEquality
```doenet-example
<p>Your responses to these questions must exactly match our answers!</p>
<p><m>2x + 5x = </m>
  <answer symbolicEquality>7x</answer>
</p>
<p><m>x^2 + 2x^2 + 3x + x</m>
  <answer symbolicEquality>3x^2 + 4x</answer>
</p> 
```



Note that you cannot repeat the original expression in the first question, and you cannot commute the terms in the second question.


For answer validation that is more liberal (but still stricter than the default numerical checker), 
combine `symbolicEquality` with the `simplifyOnCompare` and `expandOnCompare` attributes.



---

### Example: forceFullCheckWorkButton
```doenet-example
<p><m>2x + 5x = </m>
  <answer>7x</answer>
</p>
<p><m>2x + 5x</m>
  <answer forceFullCheckworkButton>7x</answer>
</p>  
<p><m>2x + 5x</m>
  <answer forceFullCheckworkButton submitLabel="check!">7x</answer>
</p>
<p>Move the below point to the first quadrant.
  <answer><award><when>
    $P.x > 0 & $P.y>0
  </when></award></answer>
</p>
<graph size="small">
  <point name="P" />
</graph>
```



When an ` <answer>{:dn}` has an input field inside it, it will, by default use a small checkwork button to the right of the 
input field.  To override this default and use the large button, add the  `forceFullCheckWorkButton` attribute.


An answer without an input field always uses the large button.


With the large button, it is also possible to customize the message on the button using the `submitLabel` attribute.



---

### Example: simplifyOnCompare
```doenet-editor-horiz
<p>Enter anything mathematically equivalent to <m>x^2+2x+1</m>: 
  <answer>x^2+2x+1</answer></p>

<p>Enter <m>x^2+2x+1</m> exactly: 
  <answer symbolicEquality>x^2+2x+1</answer></p>

<p>Enter <m>x^2+2x+1</m> or some mathematically equivalent forms (not factored): 
  <answer symbolicEquality simplifyOnCompare>x^2+2x+1</answer></p>

<p>Pick level of simplification:
  <choiceinput name="simpOnComp" inline preselectChoice="1">
    <choice>none</choice>
    <choice>numbersPreserveOrder</choice>
    <choice>numbers</choice>
    <choice>full</choice>
  </choiceinput>
</p>

<p>
  Enter <m>x^2+2x+1</m>:
  <answer symbolicEquality simplifyOnCompare="$simpOnComp">x^2+2x+1</answer></p>
```



Specifying the `symbolicEquality` attribute switches to a symbolic answer-checker that demands exact syntatical equality.  The symbolic equality can be relaxed with the `simplifyOnCompare` attribute.


The `simplifyOnCompare` attribute has four options:

* `simplifyOnCompare="none"`: the default value of demanding exact equality.
* `simplifyOnCompare="full"` (or simply `simplifyOnCompare` by itself): apply currently available simplification routines before checking.  Does not include expanding factored expressions.
* `simplifyOnCompare="numbers"`: simplify numerical expressions like `1+2` but not algebraic expressions.  Permute terms and factors into a canonical order before checking equality.
* `simplifyOnCompare="numbersPreserveOrder"`: simplify numbers but without permuting terms or factors.



To include expansion of factored expressions, you can add the `expandOnCompare` attribute.



---

### Example: expandOnCompare
```doenet-editor-horiz
<p>Enter anything mathematically equivalent to <m>x^2+2x+1</m>: 
  <answer>x^2+2x+1</answer></p>

<p>Enter <m>x^2+2x+1</m> exactly: 
  <answer symbolicEquality>x^2+2x+1</answer></p>

<p>Enter <m>x^2+2x+1</m> or some mathematically equivalent forms (not factored): 
  <answer symbolicEquality simplifyOnCompare>x^2+2x+1</answer></p>

<p>Enter <m>x^2+2x+1</m> in factored or unfactored form: 
  <answer symbolicEquality simplifyOnCompare expandOnCompare>x^2+2x+1</answer></p>
```

The default comparison is a numerical answer-checker with a liberal definition of equality.  
Specifying the `symbolicEquality` attribute switches to a symbolic answer-checker 
that demands exact syntatical equality.  The symbolic equality can be relaxed with 
the `simplifyOnCompare` attribute. To expand factor expressions prior to comparison,  
you should also include the `expandOnCompare` attribute.

### Example: unorderedCompare
```doenet-example
<p>Enter <m>1,2,3,4,5</m> :
  <answer>
    <mathList>1 2 3 4 5</mathList>
  </answer></p>

<p>Now enter <m>1,2,3,4,5</m>, but scramble the order up :
  <answer unorderedCompare>
    <mathList>1 2 3 4 5</mathList>
  </answer></p>

<p>Again, enter <m>1,2,3,4,5</m>, but scramble the order up :
  <answer>
    <mathList unordered>1 2 3 4 5</mathList>
  </answer></p>
```



When multiple values are compared within a single ` <answer>{:dn}` tag, the 
default behavior is to match the order of the sequenced values. If order is 
irrelevant, use the `unorderedCompare` attribute.


`unorderedCompare` can be used with list components (e.g., ` <mathList>{:dn}`, ` <numberList>{:dn}`, 
and ` <textList>{:dn}`) as well as the ` <math>{:dn}` component containing a list (e.g, $1,2,3$), tuple 
(e.g., $(1,2,3)$) or array (e.g., $[1,2,3]$).


Alternatively, and for more control over what is ordered, one can add the `unordered` attribute 
directly to a list component or a ` <math>{:dn}`, which will cause an unordered comparison 
to be used when comparing it to anything else.



---

### Example: matchByExactPositions
```doenet-example
  <p>Earn partial credit by getting some of the components of <m>(1,2,3,4)</m> correct:</p>
  <answer matchPartial matchByExactPositions>(1,2,3,4)</answer>

  <p>Earn partial credit by getting some of the numbers <m>1,2,3,4</m> entered in order:</p>
  <p><answer matchPartial>1,2,3,4</answer></p>
```



The attribute `matchByExactPositions` influences how the `matchPartial` calculates partial 
credit involving vectors, lists, and related quantities.  Without `matchByExactPositions`, 
the vectors $(3,1,2)$ and $(1,2,3)$ would be deemed by `matchPartial` to have a 67% match, as 
both contain the sequence $1,2$, even though no components match.  With `matchByExactPositions`, 
they would have a 0% match, as none of the first, second or third coordinates match.


In general, for a comparison of vectors, one would want to include `matchByExactPositions` along 
with `matchPartial` to give partial credit only for matches in a coordinate.  For comparing 
ordered lists, `matchByExactPositions` may not be desired.


`matchByExactPositions` implies an ordered comparison, so attributes like `unorderedCompare` and `unordered` are ignored.

### Example: numAwardsCredited
```doenet-example
   <p>Enter an even number greater than 6:
    <answer numAwardsCredited="2">
      <mathInput name="userNumber"/>
      <award credit="0.5"><when>
        $userNumber > 6
      </when></award>
      <award credit="0.5"><when>
        <mod>$userNumber 2</mod> = 0
      </when></award>
    </answer>
   </p>
```



By default, if an ` <answer>{:dn}` has multiple ` <award>{:dn}` children, only a single 
award will be credited.  If multiple awards match, then the award with the largest credit 
will be chosen (with order in the document breaking ties).


The behavior can be changed by setting the `numAwardsCredited` attribute to an 
integer larger than the default of 1.  If `numAwardsCredited="2"`, then up to two ` <award>{:dn}`s can 
be matched, and the credit achieved will the sum of their corresponding credits (up to a maximum of 1).


Combining multiple ` <award>{:dn}`s with `numAwardsCredited` can be an approach for 
assigning partial credit based on different required aspects of the answer.
