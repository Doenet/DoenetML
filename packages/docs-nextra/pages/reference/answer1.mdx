# ` <answer>{:dn}`

## Basic Use Examples


` <answer>{:dn}` is an [Evaluation](../document_structure/essentialConcepts#component-types) component that
defines content for which the user is awarded credit or is required to provide a response.


The following examples illustrate some of the basic answer forms.  
See the following pages for more complex examples, attributes and properties.





---

### Example: Default math ` <answer>{:dn}`
```doenet-example
<p><m>7x + 3x = </m><answer>10x</answer></p>
```


Note that, by default, *any expression* that is mathematically 
equivalent to $10x$ is considered correct, so the user can type the 
given expression and receive full credit in this case. See further examples on how to refine this behavior.



---

### Example: Default text  `<answer>{:dn}`
```doenet-example
<p>Type <c>banana</c>: <answer type="text">banana</answer></p>
```


Value entered into the ` <textInput/>{:dn}` must match exactly (default is case-sensitive) to the 
provided response, excluding white space at the beginning and end.


---

### Example: `<answer>{:dn}` with multiple awards
```doenet-editor-horiz
<p>Enter a prime number between 0 and 10:
  <answer>
    <award>2</award>
    <award>3</award>
    <award>5</award>
    <award>7</award>
  </answer>
</p>
```

One or more  `<award>{:dn}` components enclosing correct responses may be nested inside 
an  `<answer>{:dn}` component to give credit for different answers. Individual awards may 
also have different credit values assigned, see further examples on how to refine awarding for partial credit.

---

### Example: `<answer>{:dn}`  with basic logic
```doenet-editor-horiz
<p>Enter an even number greater than 6:
<answer>
  <mathInput name="userNumber"/>
  <award>
    <when>$userNumber > 6 and <mod>$userNumber 2</mod> = 0</when>
  </award>
</answer>
</p>
```

This example illustrates the use of some simple validation logic that can be constructed 
with an `<answer>{:dn}` tag that references a named `<mathInput/>{:dn}`. Credit is 
awarded when the boolean contained within the `<when>{:dn}` component evaluates to true. 
Multiple `<award>{:dn}` components may also be used for answers with more complex validation logic.


---

### Example: `<answer>{:dn}` for graded free-response
```doenet-example
<p>Explain how you solved the problem: 
  <answer type="text" handGraded expanded forceFullCheckworkButton />
</p>
```



The `handGraded` attribute defers grading for a human to score later. 
 When combined with the `expanded` attribute of a text answer, the result is a 
 graded free-response style question.  The `forceFullCheckworkButton` attribute was added just for aesthetics.
