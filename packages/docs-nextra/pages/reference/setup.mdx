# ` <setup>{:dn}`



` <setup>{:dn}`is a [**Sectional**](../document_structure/essentialConcepts/#componentTypes) component that acts as a container element 
for defining other components. Content defined within the ` <setup>{:dn}` portion will not be rendered.

## Attributes and Properties 

The ` <setup>{:dn}` component has no attributes or props.

### Example: Defining maths in a ` <setup>{:dn}`


```doenet-editor-horiz
<setup>
  <math name="a">3</math>
  <math name="b">4</math>
  <math name="c">sqrt($a^2+$b^2)</math>
</setup>

<p>Given a triangle with side lengths $a and $b, the length of the hypotenuse is given by <me>$c = $c{simplify}.</me>
</p>
```



Components can be defined in a ` <setup>{:dn}` and referenced later in the document with the `$name`
notation.

### Example: Defining geometry in a ` <setup>{:dn}`


```doenet-editor-horiz
<setup>
  <point name="p">(-3,2)</point>
  <line name="line1">y = 2x - 3</line>
  <circle name="circ1" radius="6"/>
</setup>

<graph size="small">
  $p $line1 $circ1
</graph>    
```



Components can be defined in a ` <setup>{:dn}` and referenced later in the document with the `$name` notation.



---

### Example: Using a ` <setup>{:dn}` within a ` <graph>{:dn}`


```doenet-editor-horiz
<p>Move the point to make it turn red.</p>
<graph size="small">
  <point name="p">(-3,2)</point>
  <setup>
    <boolean name="pMoved">
      $p != (-3,2)
    </boolean>
  </setup>
  <updateValue target="p.styleNumber" triggerWhen="$pMoved" newValue="2" type="number"/>
</graph>
```



A ` <setup>{:dn}` block can also occur in a ` <graph>{:dn}`. In this case, we don't want the ` <boolean>{:dn}` value to render on the ` <graph>{:dn}`, we just want to define it near the ` <updateValue>{:dn}` that is using it.
