# ` <section>{:dn}`


` <section>{:dn}` is a [Sectional](../document_structure/essentialConcepts#component-types)
component that renders an auto-numbered block of content. Inline components such as 
paragraphs (` <p>{:dn}`) and other components can be nested within a ` <section>{:dn}` to 
group and order content. Some examples are: another ` <section>{:dn}`, 
a ` <figure>{:dn}`, or a `<problem>{:dn}`.


## Attributes and Properties 
 <AttrDisplay name='section'/> 
 <PropDisplay name='section'/>


---

### Example: ` <section>{:dn}` with default title


```doenet-editor-horiz
<section>
  <p><lorem generateWords="10"/></p>
</section>


<example>
  <p>Interactive activity here.</p>
</example>

<problem>
  <p><answer>42</answer></p>
</problem>
```



Within a DoenetML document, default titles for sectional components are 
auto-numbered. Each sectional component is on the same counter.



---

### Example: `<section>{:dn}` with custom title


```doenet-editor-horiz
<section><title>Latest news</title>
  <p>Doenet taking the world by storm!</p>
</section>
```



A custom ` <section>{:dn}` title is creating by providing a ` <title>{:dn}` 
tag within the ` <section>{:dn}`.



---

### Example: How to create a subsection


```doenet-editor-horiz
<section><title>This is the main section.</title>
  <p><lorem generateWords="10"/></p>
  <section><title>This is a subsection</title>
    <p><lorem generateWords="10"/></p>
  </section>
</section>
```



A subsection is created by nesting one or more sections within a ` <section>{:dn}`.



---

### Example: named ` <section>{:dn}` as a parent reference


```doenet-editor-horiz
<section name="treeSection" boxed>
  <text name="plant">Weeping Willow</text>
  <p>$plant</p>
</section>

<section name="flowerSection" boxed>
  <text name="plant">Daffodil</text>
  <p>$plant</p>
</section>

<p>From first section: 
  The plant is $treeSection.plant.</p>
<p>From second section: 
  The plant is $flowerSection.plant.</p>
```

When reference names are used more than once in the same document,
they can be distinguished (when outside their parent component) by 
attaching the name of the parent component to the reference.


Above, the ` <section>{:dn}` named `treeSection` is the
parent of the `<text>{:dn}` named `plant`. Therefore, when 
referencing this specific instance of the component with that name, 
you should use `$treeSection.plant` as shown.

### Attribute Example: includeParentNumber


```doenet-example
<section boxed>
  <section>
    <p>This content is inside a nested section. The default number includes the parent number as well.</p>
  </section>
</section>
<section boxed>
  <section includeParentNumber="false">
    <p>This content is inside a nested section. Rendering of the parent section number has been repressed.</p>
  </section>
</section>
```



The `includeParentNumber` attribute is `true` by default for the ` <section>{:dn}` component (and `false` for other sectional components, such as ` <problem>{:dn}` and ` <exercise>{:dn}`). This allows the default numbering system to include the number of the parent sectional component, followed by the number of the ` <section>{:dn}`.


If it is preferable to display the section number without the parent section preceding it, set the `includeParentNumber` attribute to `false`.



---

### Attribute Example: includeAutoNumber


```doenet-example
  <section boxed><title>Custom title</title>
    <p>In this section, the custom title overrides the default numbering of the section.</p>
  </section>

  <section boxed includeAutoNumber="true">
    <title>Special title</title>
    <p>In this section, the number of the section is still rendered in addition to the custom title.</p>
  </section>
```



The `includeAutoNumber` attribute is `false` by default for the ` <section>{:dn}` component. This 
means that if a section contains a nested ` <title>{:dn}`, it will not render the default 
numbering (although it will still be counted in the numbering scheme behind the scenes).


In order to display the section number in addition to the custom ` <title>{:dn}`, set 
the `includeAutoNumber` attribute to `true`.



---

### Attribute Example: aggregateScores and sectionWideCheckWork


```doenet-example
<section sectionWideCheckWork aggregateScores><title>Multiple questions</title>
  <p>Enter <m>x</m>: <answer>x</answer></p>
  <p>Enter <m>y</m>: <answer>y</answer></p>
  <p>Enter <m>z</m>: <answer>z</answer></p>
</section>
```



The `aggregateScores` and `sectionWideCheckWork` attributes together combine 
validation for all ` <answer>{:dn}` components within the ` <section>{:dn}` under a 
single "Check Work" button.


---

### Attribute Example: boxed


```doenet-example
<section boxed><title>Boxed section</title>
  <p><lorem generateWords="10"/></p>
</section>
```



The `boxed` attribute changes the default formatting for section to one 
that has a border and a shaded banner for the title.



---

### Attribute Example: hide


```doenet-example
<booleanInput name="hideSection">
  <label>Click here to hide the section</label>
</booleanInput>

<section hide="$hideSection"><title>Now you see me...</title>
  <p><lorem generateWords="10"/></p>
</section>
```



The `hide` attribute takes a boolean as input and can be used with any rendered component.
