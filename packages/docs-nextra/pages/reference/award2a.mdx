# ` <award>{:dn}`

## Attribute Examples Part 1

The following examples illustrate use of the ` <award>{:dn}` tag attributes.  

---


### Attribute Example: credit
```doenet-example
<p><em>For the following question, first enter <m>\frac{4}{8}</m> and 
then <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>.</em></p>

<p>Question: Simplify <m>\frac{8}{16}</m>
<answer symbolicEquality>
  <award>1/2</award>
  <award credit="0.5">4/8</award>
</answer>
</p>
```



By default, a matched ` <award>{:dn}` will give full credit of 1.  Specify a 
smaller value of the `credit` attribute cause the ` <award>{:dn}` to give partial credit.


---

### Attribute Example: matchPartial
```doenet-editor-horiz
<p>Enter an even number greater than 6:
  <answer>
    <mathInput name="userNumber"/>
    <award matchPartial>
      <when>$userNumber > 6 and <mod>$userNumber 2</mod> = 0</when>
    </award>
  </answer>
</p>

<p>What is <m>(1,2,3)+(4,5,6)</m>? 
  <answer>
    <award matchPartial>(5,7,9)</award></answer>
</p>
```



When the `matchPartial` attribute is applied, an automated partial credit evaluation will be attempted, 
potentially giving credit between 0 and 1.  Without the `matchPartial` attribute, the response must 
be completely correct before it receives credit.


The automated partial credit algorithm will attempt to break up logical conditions into pieces and 
look separately at components of vectors.


For comparison of vectors, the attributes `matchByExactPositions` and `unorderedCompare` influence 
the partial credit algorithm.

### Attribute Example: symbolicEquality
```doenet-editor-horiz
<p>Your responses to these questions must exactly match our answers!</p>
<p><m>2x + 5x = </m>
  <answer>
    <award symbolicEquality>7x</award>
  </answer>
</p>

<p><m>x^2 + 2x^2 + 3x + x</m>
  <answer>
    <award symbolicEquality>3x^2 + 4x</award>
  </answer>
</p> 
```



Note that you cannot repeat the original expression in the first question, and you cannot 
commute the terms in the second question.


For answer validation that is more liberal (but still stricter than the default 
numerical checker), combine `symbolicEquality` with the `simplifyOnCompare` and 
`expandOnCompare` attributes.

### Attribute Example: symbolicEquality with simplifyOnCompare
```doenet-editor-horiz
<p>Enter anything mathematically equivalent to <m>x^2+2x+1</m>: 
  <answer>
    <award>x^2+2x+1</award>
  </answer></p>

<p>Enter <m>x^2+2x+1</m> exactly: 
  <answer>
    <award symbolicEquality>x^2+2x+1</award>
  </answer></p>

<p>Enter <m>x^2+2x+1</m> or some mathematically equivalent forms (not factored): 
  <answer>
    <award symbolicEquality simplifyOnCompare>x^2+2x+1</award>
  </answer></p>

<p>Pick a level of simplification:
  <choiceInput name="simpOnComp" inline preselectChoice="1">
    <choice>none</choice>
    <choice>numbersPreserveOrder</choice>
    <choice>normalizeOrder</choice>
    <choice>numbers</choice>
    <choice>full</choice>
  </choiceInput>
</p>

<p>
  Enter <m>x^2+2x+1</m>:
  <answer>
    <award symbolicEquality simplifyOnCompare="$simpOnComp">x^2+2x+1</award>
  </answer></p>
```



Specifying the `symbolicEquality` attribute switches to a symbolic answer-checker that 
demands exact syntatical equality.  The symbolic equality can be relaxed with the `simplifyOnCompare` attribute.


The `simplifyOnCompare` attribute has five options:
* `simplifyOnCompare="none"`: the default value of demanding exact equality.
* `simplifyOnCompare="full"` (or simply `simplifyOnCompare` by itself): apply currently available simplification routines before checking.  Does not include expanding factored expressions.
* `simplifyOnCompare="numbers"`: simplify numerical expressions like `1+2` but not algebraic expressions.  Permute terms and factors into a canonical order before checking equality.
* `simplifyOnCompare="numbersPreserveOrder"`: simplify numbers but without permuting terms or factors.
* `simplifyOnCompare="normalizeOrder"`: permute terms and factors to a standard order but perform no other simplifications.


To include expansion of factored expressions, you can add the `expandOnCompare` attribute.

Note: if `symbolicEquality` is not specified, `simplifyOnCompare` has no effect.

### Attribute Example: symbolicEquality with expandOnCompare
```doenet-editor-horiz
<p>Enter anything mathematically equivalent to <m>x^2+2x+1</m>: 
  <answer>
    <award>x^2+2x+1</award>
  </answer></p>

<p>Enter <m>x^2+2x+1</m> exactly: 
  <answer>
    <award symbolicEquality>x^2+2x+1</award>
  </answer></p>

<p>Enter <m>x^2+2x+1</m> or some mathematically equivalent forms (not factored): 
  <answer>
    <award symbolicEquality simplifyOnCompare>x^2+2x+1</award>
  </answer></p>

<p>Enter <m>x^2+2x+1</m> in factored or unfactored form: 
  <answer>
    <award symbolicEquality simplifyOnCompare expandOnCompare>x^2+2x+1</award>
  </answer></p>
```

The default comparison is a numerical answer-checker with a liberal definition of 
equality. Specifying the `symbolicEquality` attribute switches to a symbolic 
answer-checker that demands exact syntatical equality. The symbolic equality can be 
relaxed with the `simplifyOnCompare` attribute. To expand factor expressions prior to 
comparison, you should also include the `expandOnCompare` attribute.


Note: if `symbolicEquality` is not specified, `expandOnCompare` has no effect.

### Attribute Example: unorderedCompare and unordered
```doenet-editor-horiz
<p>Enter <m>1,2,3,4,5</m> :
  <answer><award>
    <mathList>1 2 3 4 5</mathList>
  </award></answer></p>

<p>Now enter <m>1,2,3,4,5</m>, but scramble the order up :
  <answer><award unorderedCompare>
    <mathList>1 2 3 4 5</mathList>
  </award></answer></p>

<p>Again, enter <m>1,2,3,4,5</m>, but scramble the order up :
  <answer><award>
    <mathList unordered>1 2 3 4 5</mathList>
  </award></answer></p>
```



When multiple values are compared within a single ` <award>{:dn}` tag, the default behavior 
is to match the order of the sequenced values. If order is irrelevant, use the `unorderedCompare` attribute.


`unorderedCompare` can be used with list components (e.g., ` <mathList>{:dn}`, ` <numberList>{:dn}`, 
and ` <textList>{:dn}`) as well as the ` <math>{:dn}` component containing a list (e.g, `1,2,3`), 
tuple (e.g., `(1,2,3)`) or array (e.g., `[1,2,3]`).


Alternatively, and for more control over what is ordered, one can add the `unordered` attribute 
directly to a list component or a ` <math>{:dn}`, which will cause an unordered comparison to 
be used when comparing it to anything else.
