# ` <asList>{:dn}`

**Disclaimer:** *This component is deprecated. Using ` <asList>{:dn}` is no longer required, as commas are
automatically added between items in a sequence or repeat. However, using it will not 
cause an error.*

---

` <asList>{:dn}` is a [Paragraph Markup](../document_structure/essentialConcepts#component-types) component
that renders a formatted list when it surrounds ` <sequence/>{:dn}`
or a `<repeat>{:dn}`. It does not need to be nested within a `<p>` tag. 

## Attributes and Properties 
 The ` <asList>{:dn}` component does not have any attributes.
 <PropDisplay name='asList'/>

### Example: ` <asList>{:dn}` with a ` <sequence>{:dn}`


```doenet-example
<p><sequence from="1" to="10"/></p>
<p><asList><sequence from="1" to="10"/></asList></p>
```


In the latest versions of doenetML, the `<asList>{:dn}` component is no longer necessary, 
as commas are automatically added between items in a sequence or repeat.
