# ` <answer>{:dn}`

## Advanced Use Examples

The following examples illustrate some of the advanced answer forms.

## Designating Responses
When using the full logic of an ` <award>{:dn}` tag, the expression inside the ` <when>{:dn}`
can refer to components outside the ` <answer>{:dn}` tag.  However, in this case, Doenet cannot tell what 
values should be considered the **response** of that answer.  When basing an answer on inputs outside the 
` <answer>{:dn}` tag, you must indicate what values are to be used for the responses.   There are three ways 
to tell Doenet that a value is a response: adding an `isResponse` attribute to the value, adding a 
`referencesAreResponses` attribute to the ` <award>{:dn}`, or adding a 
` <considerAsResponses>{:dn}` child to the ` <award>{:dn}`. 

The **response** of an answer is what the user entered to be evaluated for credit.  For a typical answer, the response is what 
the user entered in the blank or selected from a lists of choices.  Doenet always uses any input tag (e.g., ` <mathInput/>{:dn}`, 
` <textInput>{:dn}`, ` <choiceInput/>{:dn}`) inside the ` <answer>{:dn}` tag for the response.  Any other value referenced 
inside a ` <when>{:dn}` is not considered a response, by default.
  
Although answer responses do not affect the credit awarded, they are used for the data analytics and giving feedback to 
instructors and authors.  They can also be referenced inside the DoenetML document to create dynamic content that depends 
on the user's response. Every answer should have some values flagged as the responses.

See the examples below for how to use each of these methods to designate a response.

### Example: using the `isResponse` attribute to designate responses






### Example: using the `referencesAreResponses` attribute in the ` <award>{:dn}`
```doenet-editor
<p>In the graph below, one curve represents a function <m>f</m>, and one curve
  represents its derivative. Click the derivative of the function to change its color. 
  Then, click the button to check your work.</p>

<graph>
  <function name="f">x^2</function>
  <derivative name="fPrime">$f</derivative>
  <triggerSet anchor="(-6,-6)">
    <updateValue target="$fPrime.styleNumber" newValue="1"/>
    <updateValue target="$f.styleNumber" newValue="1"/>
    <label>Reset Graph</label>
</triggerSet>
  <legend>
    <label forObject="$f"><m>f(x)</m></label>
    <label forObject="$fPrime"><m>\frac{d}{dx}f(x)</m></label>
  </legend>
</graph>

  
<updateValue target="$f.styleNumber" newValue="2" triggerWhenObjectsClicked="$f"/>
<updateValue target="$fPrime.styleNumber" newValue="2" triggerWhenObjectsClicked="$fPrime"/>
  

<answer name="ans1">
  <award referencesAreResponses="$fPrime.styleNumber">
    <when>$f.styleNumber = 1 and $fPrime.styleNumber = 2</when>
  </award>
</answer>

<p>Submitted Response: $ans1.submittedResponses</p>
```
In this example, the `referencesAreResponses` attribute is used in the `<award>{:dn}` tag 
to indicate that `$fPrime.styleNumber` is the **response** for this answer. 

When this attribute is not included, both `$f.styleNumber` and `$fPrime.styleNumber` are considered responses, which could lead 
to confusion when analyzing the collected data.



### Example: using ` <considerAsResponses>{:dn}` to designate responses

```doenet-editor
<setup>
  <number name="x">2</number>
  <number name="y">-1</number>
</setup>
<p>Move the point such that the <m>x</m>-coordinate
is greater than <m>$x</m> and the <m>y</m>-coordinate
is less than <m>$y</m>.</p>

  <graph><point name="P" x="-5" y="3" /></graph>

<p><alert>Without <tag>considerAsResponses</tag>:</alert></p>
<p>
<answer name="ans1">
    <award>
      <when>
        $P.x > $x and $P.y < $y
      </when>
    </award>
</answer></p>

<p>submittedResponses = $ans1.submittedResponses</p>

<p><alert>With <tag>considerAsResponses</tag>:</alert></p>
<p>
<answer name="ans2">
    <award>
      <when>
        $P.x > $x and $P.y < $y
      </when>
    </award>
  <considerAsResponses>$P</considerAsResponses>
</answer></p>

<p>$ans2.submittedResponses</p>
```

In this example, the ` <considerAsResponses>{:dn}` tag is used to indicate that the 
coordinates of point `$P` is the **response** for this answer. 

When the ` <considerAsResponses>{:dn}` child is not included, all four values `$P.x`, `$P.y`, `$x`, and `$y` are considered responses, 
which is not desirable in this case.
