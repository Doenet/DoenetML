# ` <considerAsResponses>{:dn}`

` <considerAsResponses>{:dn}` is an [Evaluation](../document_structure/essentialConcepts#component-types)
component that informs Doenet which component to designate as a "response". This is not required for correct answer evaluation, but can help disambiguate user response data 
for instructor review. 

There is **no** need to use ` <considerAsResponses>{:dn}` in the following common situations:
* the `<answer>{:dn}` tag does not have any `<award>{:dn}` children
* the `<answer>{:dn}` tag has a nested `<mathInput/>{:dn}`, `<textInput/>{:dn}`, `<choice>{:dn}` 
or `<choiceInput/>{:dn}`
* the `<answer>{:dn}` tag *does* have `<award>{:dn}` children, but in all cases there is only 
  one available component referenced that could be considered a response (In this case, the single component
  reference is automatically processed as the
  "response", so there is no need for the ` <considerAsResponses>{:dn}` tag clarification.)

However, it is good practice to use the ` <considerAsResponses>{:dn}` in the following situations:
* an `<award>{:dn}` child is used with the `<answer>{:dn}` tag, and multiple components are 
  referenced within the `<award>{:dn}` (not all of which are "responses")
* no nested input components are used within the `<answer>{:dn}` tag, and there is ambiguity in the submitted response
  data



## Attributes and Properties 
The ` <considerAsResponses>{:dn}` component has no attributes or properties.

### Example: ` <considerAsResponses>{:dn}` for graphical component


```doenet-editor
<p>Move point <m>A</m> so that is reflected
  across the <m>x</m>-axis from point <m>B</m></p>

<graph grid="1 1">
  <point name="A" labelIsName>
    (-4,-7)
    <constraints>
      <constrainToGrid/>
    </constraints>
  </point>
  <point name="B" 
    labelIsName 
    fixed
    styleNumber="2">
    (5,3)
  </point>
</graph>

<answer name="ans1">
  <award>
    <when>
      $A.x = $B.x and $A.y = -$B.y
    </when>
  </award>
  <considerAsResponses>$A</considerAsResponses>
</answer>

<p>Submitted response for answer: $ans1.submittedResponse</p>
```



The ` <considerAsResponses>{:dn}` component designates which graphical 
element Doenet should store as a response for the named ` <answer>{:dn}`. 
Without designating `$A` as the response, both data for points `$A`
and `$B` will appear in the **Submitted response** tab.

You can test this behavior by answering the question on the right-hand
side and clicking the blue "Check Work" button. Then, click where it 
says "1 Submitted response"
in the bottom of the editor panel on the left-hand side.

### Example: ` <considerAsResponses>{:dn}` for multiple components

```doenet-editor
<setup>
  <text name="bestAnimal">kapybara</text>
</setup>

<p>Choose your favorite rodent: 
  <choiceInput name="animal">
    <choice>dog</choice>
    <choice>elephant</choice>
    <choice>kapybara</choice>
  </choiceInput>
</p>

<p>Put the point inside the circle.</p>
<graph size="small">
  <circle name="circ" radius="5" fixed/>
  <point name="P">(7,7)</point>
  <lineSegment 
    name="ptDist" 
    endpoints="$circ.center $P"
    hide/>
</graph>

<answer name="ans1" matchPartial>
  <award>
    <when>
      $animal = $bestAnimal and
      $ptDist.length < $circ.radius
    </when>
  </award>
  <considerAsResponses>
    $animal $ptDist.length
  </considerAsResponses>
</answer>
```


The ` <considerAsResponses>{:dn}` tag can contain multiple
component references and can also refer to component properties.

Without the ` <considerAsResponses>{:dn}` specification as shown,
data for `$animal`, `$bestAnimal`, `$ptDist.length`
and `$circ.radius` will all appear in the **Submitted response** tab.

You can test this behavior by answering the question on the right-hand
side, and then click where it says "1 Submitted response"
in the bottom of the editor panel on the left-hand side.
