### Patch Changes

- 75725e5: Improve DoenetML editor autocomplete for references.

    The editor now suggests in-scope names after `$`, offers descendant names and
    properties after `.` on references, and handles completion reopening more
    reliably while typing, deleting, and accepting completions.

- e604d76: expose schemaSubarrays-derived properties in generated Doenet schema to improve documentation
- 544c619: Add graph attributes to control axis tick visibility.

    Graphs now support `displayXAxisTicks` and `displayYAxisTicks`. Tick labels inherit from the corresponding tick visibility setting unless `displayXAxisTickLabels` or `displayYAxisTickLabels` is explicitly specified.

- b380ebc: Improve reference autocomplete behavior by wiring Rust-backed resolver logic and fixing completion visibility/index handling.

    This includes better scope filtering for names, indexed reference completions for takesIndex components, and repeat synthetic name support in autocomplete flows.
