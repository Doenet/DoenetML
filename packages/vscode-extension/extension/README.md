## Usage

### Identifying Doenet Documents

Open the a folder in VSCode. Open any of your source documents. If it has a `.doenet` file extension, it should be identified as a Doenet document, and you will see "Doenet" as the language in the bottom right corner of the window. You can associate other file extensions with the Doenet language using the "Files: Associations" setting (Ctrl+, brings up settings). Or you can select Doenet for a particular document using the "Change Language Mode" command.

Having a document identified as a Doenet document will give you:

-   Syntax highlighting
-   Schema validation

## Change log
