### Patch Changes

- ace8b55: Reword the one-sentence component summaries surfaced by the editor's context-sensitive help and the schema.
    - ~234 per-component summaries (the `static componentDocs.summary` on each component class) were reconciled against the prior reference-docs wording. The worker class is now the single source of truth; the alphabetical and by-type reference indexes are generated from it.
    - Style is uniform across all 245 components: starts with a capital letter; no trailing period.
    - A handful of substantive corrections, most notably `<pretzel>` (which previously described itself as "a figure for visualizing logical compositions of subsets of the reals" — entirely wrong; now describes its actual response-matching behavior) and `<attractToConstraint>` (which had mirrored `<attractTo>`'s description instead of its own).
    - The autocomplete-popup hover text, the in-editor help panel, and any other surface that reads `componentDocs.summary` will all show the new wording.

- 63a0079: Schema cleanup and reference docs additions.
    - Hide non-functional or PreTeXt-compat-only components from the generated schema (and therefore from autocomplete and the auto-generated reference docs): `<markers>` (slider helper currently broken — tracked in #1164), `<topic>` (PreTeXt-compat alias), `<dataFrame>` and `<summaryStatistics>` (experimental, no source mechanism yet).
    - Refresh wording of two `<annotation>` attribute descriptions (`speech`, `sonify`) to match how Prefigure's screen-reader features actually surface to learners.
    - Add 22 new author-facing reference pages covering previously-undocumented components (annotation, annotations, cascade, cascadeMessage, cellBlock, clampFunction, codeEditor, column, displayDoenetML, extractMathOperator, feedbackDefinition, givenAnswer, latex, lcm, note, periodicSet, pluralize, solveEquations, tagc, tage, variantControl, wrapFunctionPeriodic), plus cross-link additions on existing `<option>`, `<select>`, `<feedback>`, `<award>`, `<tag>` pages. Every component now in the generated schema is documented (`check:docs-coverage` reports `0 unresolved` with an empty allow-list).

- fb3ebdf: Fix `<latex>` crashing when one of its children lacks a `latex` state variable. Constructs like `<latex><text>foo</text></latex>`, `<latex>$mathInput.latex</latex>` (where `<mathInput>` does not expose a `.latex` prop), or any reference whose resolved component lacks `latex` previously raised "Unknown state variable latex of `<idx>`" from the worker, which leaked the internal state-variable name to the rendered viewer. The `<latex>` value-dependency now marks `text`/`latex` as optional on its children, matching `<m>`/`<me>`/`<md>`, so children without `latex` fall back to their `text` value.
- f16dd18: `<subsetOfRealsInput>` improvements:
    - Propagate the input's `variable` through `extend`. Previously, `<subsetOfReals extend="$input" displayMode="inequalities" />` ignored the input's variable and rendered with the `<subsetOfReals>` default `x`. The `subsetValue` shadowing instructions now include the `variable` attribute, matching the pattern `<mathInput>` uses for its number-display attributes.
    - Hide attributes that the renderer currently ignores from the generated schema (`xMin`, `xMax`, `width`, `height`, `dx`, `xlabel`) via `excludeFromSchema: true` so they no longer appear in autocomplete or auto-generated docs. The attributes remain on the class — this is a documentation/schema cleanup, not a behavior change for documents that already set them.
    - Add the long-missing reference page at `packages/docs-nextra/pages/reference/subsetOfRealsInput.mdx`, with a regression test exercising the variable-shadowing fix and an updated alphabetical-index entry.
